                    You are being invited to participate in a research study titled “Investigating the social perceptions of faces.”

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This study is being done by Dr. Garrison Cottrell from the University of California - San Diego (UCSD).
                        You were selected to participate in this study because you are over the age of 18.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The purpose of this research study is to understand how humans form first impressions after looking at faces.
                        If you agree to take part in this study, you will be asked to complete an online survey/questionnaire.
                        This survey/questionnaire will ask you to see a number of photos and indicate your impression of the person on the photo.
                        (e.g. How attractive this person looks to me? Or which face looks more attractive to you?)

                        In addition, you will be asked about your demographic background.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        It may take you approximately 10-20 minutes to complete, depending on your attention level and performance.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Your responses will be compared with other participants. Your HIT will be accepted if most of your responses align with others and you are self-consistent in most of the times.
                    </p>

                    <p>There may not be any direct benefit to you from this research other than the direct payment. The investigator(s), however, may learn more about the mechanisms behind first impressions and human perception of traits in others’ faces.
                        This may also help society by furthering understanding of the science of human perception, communication, and cooperation. </p>

                    <p>There are minimal risks associated with this research study:
                    <ul>
                    <li>
                        Online data being hacked or intercepted:
                        This is a risk that can happen when you  provide information online.
                        The researcher is using a secure, encrypted system (server) to collect this data, however, it still may be possible to have your information compromised.</li>

                    <li>Boredom or fatigue: A participant may find the questions uninteresting or dull. You may also take a break if needed. </li>
                    <li>Breach of confidentiality: Researchers will remove your worker ID and replace it with a study ID to ensure confidentiality.
                        However, there is a chance the data could be seen by someone who shouldn’t have access to it.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Research records will be kept confidential to the extent allowed by law and may be reviewed by the UCSD Institutional Review Board.
                        Your payment for this task will be determined by your task performance and the market price.Your participation in this study is completely voluntary and you can withdraw at any time by simply exiting the survey.
                        Choosing not to participate or withdrawing will result in no penalty.
                        If you have questions about this project or if you have a research-related problem, you may contact the researcher(s), Dr. Garrison Cottrell (858) 534-6640 .
